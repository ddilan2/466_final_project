Problem:- 
The goal of this project is to develop a computational tool
for predicting the secondary structure of RNA molecules using the
Nussinov algorithm. The algorithm, based on dynamic programming,
identifies base pairs that maximize the number of stacked pairs
in a given RNA sequence.



To install and run the code(for both Windows and Mac), 
follow these steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using
git clone [repository_url] command.
2. Navigate to the project directory using 
cd [project_directory] command.

Installation:-

1. Run pip install pytest to install pytest.
2. Run pip install numpy to install numpy.

How to run code:-
 
1. To run main python file with nussinov, run python nussinov.py.
2. To execute testing file, run pytest.
