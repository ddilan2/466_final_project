Problem:- 
The goal of this project is to develop a computational tool
for predicting the secondary structure of RNA molecules using the
Nussinov algorithm. The algorithm, based on dynamic programming,
identifies base pairs that maximize the number of stacked pairs
in a given RNA sequence.

How to run
Please follow the instructions below to run the code.

Run pip install pytest to install pytest. 
To run main python file with nussinov, run python nussinov.py.
To execute testing file, run pytest.
